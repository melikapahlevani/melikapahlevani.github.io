- A book is just like a door that gives you a chance to escape from the harsh realities of life 
- If you lose hope, read the <strong> midnight library </strong>
- If you are looking for the meaning of life between the stories, read the <strong> confused people </strong>
- If you are waiting for a great start in life, read the <strong> deep work </strong>
